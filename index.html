This space was generously provided by SourceForge for centralizing the
<A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/projects/colorforth/">colorForth</A> source code, which was in turn generously provided by
<A HREF="http://colorforth.com/">Chuck Moore</A>.
<P>
I had nobody's authorization to do this, I just saw the need and did it.
I hope nobody is too offended.
<P>
Current development efforts are geared towards getting colorForth to run
on <A HREF="http://bochs.sourceforge.net/">Bochs</A>. To that end, I'm in
the process of converting the sources to <A HREF="as/">GNU's <CODE>as</CODE>
assembler</A> and <A HREF="nasm/">nasm</A>. I realize that Tim Neitz and
maybe others already worked on that, but my quick search didn't locate any
up-to-date sources.
<P>
I encourage multiple project contributors, even if we don't agree on
anything other than that colorForth should be more accessible to the
programming public. Email me at the address below. You know what to do with
the first dot.
