<P>
I had nobody's authorization to do this, I just saw the need and did it.
I hope nobody is too offended.
<P>
Current development efforts are in the <A
HREF="http://colorforth.cvs.sourceforge.net/colorforth/colorforth/jc2007/">
jc2007/</A> subdirectory. There is already a working, if slightly buggy,
<A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/project/screenshots.php?group_id=183060">
Mandelbrot set generator app</A>, and we will be working on networking,
sound, and possibly a web browser.
<P>
I encourage multiple project contributors, even if we don't agree on
anything other than that colorForth should be more accessible to the
programming public. Email me at the address below. You know what to do with
the first dot.
