What I like about colorForth

it's small.

it's elegant.

What I don't like about colorForth

coding in machine language. ugh. if no cF assembler yet, code the
core words in the kernel using a good (open source or free) assembler.

no built-in support for strings, another step backwards.

no built-in support for fixed-point arithmetic, another step backwards.

too many magic numbers in CM sources with no explanation.

labels and comments are cryptic, obviously meant for CM himself.
